Create Self-Signed Certificate

Patch your iPhone SDK to allow the use of this certificate:

    Launch Keychain Access.app. With no items selected, from the Keychain menu select Certificate Assistant, then Create a Certificate.
        Name: iPhone Developer
        Certificate Type: Code Signing
        Let me override defaults: Yes

    Click Continue
        Validity: 3650 days

    Click Continue

    Blank out the Email address field.

    Click Continue until complete.

    You should see "This root certificate is not trusted". This is expected.

    Set the iPhone SDK to allow the self-signed certificate to be used:

sudo /usr/bin/sed -i .bak 's/XCiPhoneOSCodeSig	nContext/XCCodeSignContext/' /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Info.plist
